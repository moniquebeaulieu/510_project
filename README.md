# 510_project
Repository for ENDG 510 Final Project

The goal of this project is to understand the concept of CPS by:
- Choosing a case study to investigate its components
- model it 
- use machine learning techniques for data analysis

Data used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/icsdataset/hai-security-dataset
(HAI 22.04)

Following industrial anomoly detection methods similar to:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9693317
(Vector quantixation and one-class support vecotr machine)


How to install and run the project: 
- Download all HAI 22.04 Train and Test CSV's into working directory.
- Run the notebook: ENDG510_OC_SVM_Anomoly_Detection_final_code_ BEAULIEU_AMER.ipynb
  (all other notebooks in this repository are iterations and EDA to get the best metrics)
- Feature exploration and manipulation are the bulk of the notebook
- Model metrics are shown in cmd 62 and 64
